But once we hit enter we might stumble with some error -- one is that the encode method can throw an error. so we know what we do, and that is to incorporate a do block, try and catch --- and finally we need to mark this method with a try and because we are inside a closure -- i.e the part that gets triggered once the user presses the add item button then we have to mark all our properties with a self.

And again, we need to mark this a self because we are again inside a closure.
