//For our SearchBar --- Every single time we've declared off you viecontrollerapp as a delegate of something we also have to make an IB outlet for our search bar and then inside viewdidload say something like searchbar.delegate = self ---- same procedure, adding the protocol in the class declaration and also setting the outlet's delegate as self.

//So what happened was were creating a new request, then we modify it with our query and our sort descriptor, and then we pass that request into our load items function on the (loadItems(with request: NSFetchRequest<Item>), and then we perform that request by saying context.fetch so we can now delete this do catch block -- on the extension todolistviewcontroller, and we can also delete tableView.reloadData() because its already inisde loaditems
